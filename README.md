### Flexbox! üí™ü•ä

I've been lucky enough to enter the world of development where Flexbox exists as an awesome and widely supported tool, and not have to experience the infamous struggle of trying to vertically center anything using older CSS properties. 

I loved learning how to use Flexbox and all its magic. I really liked the poster designed by Lynn Fisher for [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/product/css-flexbox-poster/). Seeing as it is the definitive guide, I thought recreating it would be a great exercise for me to practice using Flexbox.

The initial intention was for this to be composed on an A3 page. I would still like to do this at some point because I love the idea of this poster but shipping something so fragile to South Africa is bound to end in disappointment.


## In this exercise I aimed to learn more about: üìö
* All things Flexbox!
* Using CSS variables
* Using React Components and practicing React


## The biggest challenges I faced were: üê±‚Äçüèç
* *The gap*

## Cool things I learned: üòé
* CSS Variables
* Adding a color picker 
* [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com)
* [Flex gap](https://caniuse.com/#search=flex%20gap) isn't widely supported yet 


## Things I would like to learn next: ‚ñ∂ 
* Learning more advanced CSS selectors


## Things I would like to practice: ü§ì
* React state
* UI design

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
